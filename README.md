# React Quiz App: Moroccan Culture

Welcome to the React Quiz App focusing on Moroccan culture! This project was created with the intention of learning and understanding the concept of the useReducer hook in React.

# ðŸš€ Update! ðŸš€

I've just made a significant enhancement to my React project on GitHub (removing the old src file and adding a new one)! With a focus on enhancing scalability, maintainability, and state management, we've refactored the entire application to utilize the Context API.

# ðŸ”„ What's Changed?

Implemented the Context API to efficiently manage application-wide state.
Reorganized components to utilize context providers and consumers, streamlining data flow and reducing prop drilling.
Enhanced code readability and maintainability by centralizing state management logic.
